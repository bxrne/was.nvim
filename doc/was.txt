was.nvim - Neovim plugin to solve "What was I doing here?" when moving between directories.

FEATURES:
  - Store intentions per workspace (Git root or current directory).
  - Persistent storage across Neovim sessions.
  - Written in pure Lua for speed and simplicity.

INSTALLATION:

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):
>lua
{
  "bxrne/was.nvim",
  config = true, -- calls setup() automatically
  event = "VeryLazy",
}

Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):
>lua
use {
  'bxrne/was.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('was').setup()
  end
}

COMMANDS:
  :Was <text>    Set the intention for the current project. 
                 E.g., :Was Implementing user authentication system
  :Was           View the last stored intention for the current project.

WORKFLOW:
  - Checks for a Git root or defaults to the current directory.
  - Intention data is stored persistently in:
      `~/.local/share/nvim/was/intentions.json`.
